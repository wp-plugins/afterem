This plugin extends Events Manager to allow follow-up emails to be sent after an event.

== Description ==

After Events Mailer is designed to send emails to booking lists from ended [Events Manager](https://wordpress.org/plugins/events-manager/) events the day after they end. This plugin only sends emails to approved bookings.

The mailer will start sending emails the day after activating the plugin. The settings can be adjusted on the AfterEM page in the Events menu.

**Features**

* Email templating page (html)
* Placeholders are processed by Events Manager (booking, event, and location)
* Send test email (placeholders are not processed)
